RenderMan for Debian
===========================
# How to run
```bash
PRMan4Debian <RenderMan Forum User ID> <RenderMan Forum Password> <Serial Number> <RenderMan Version>
```
* Leaving any of the arguments except `<RenderMan Version>` empty will prompt user to input that argument later on
* Leaving `<RenderMan Version>` empty will install all available installer packages regardless of version
* Specifing `<Serial Number>` as `none` will start RenderMan installer(s) in NCR mode
* Only the last arguments could stay unspecified, i.e., one cannot specify 1st and 3rd arguments leaving 2nd unspecified
